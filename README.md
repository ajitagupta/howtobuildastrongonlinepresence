# Online

Whether you are applying for jobs, reaching out for professional advice or toying with a new startup idea your online profile will be instrumental in your success. However, it's not as easy as it might sound. Firstly, time is limited. Secondly, you have only got one chance to impress. Finally, your approach should be focused and appealing for others to take notice and reciprocate the effort.

This post deals with creating a memorable and rich online presence, perfectly suited for job seekers and forming new contacts, to put your best foot forward.

## Social Media

## LinkedIn

## Website
I have seen many people create a web page to describe themselves in detail and showcase a few projects. I do not consider this to be appropriate nor professional. Projects can easily be shared on GitHub, whereas the extra information about you is not meant to be online. Websites are mainly used in academia or research, where people enumerate their list of papaers and share their review actvities. For other purposes, LinkedIn is generally sufficient.
