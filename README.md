# Online

Whether you are applying for jobs, reaching out for professional advice or toying with a new startup idea your online profile will be instrumental in your success. However, it's not as easy as it might sound. Firstly, time is limited. Secondly, you have only got one chance to impress. Finally, your approach should be focused and appealing for others to take notice and reciprocate the effort.

This post deals at making you put your best foot forward, perfectly suited for job seekers and forming new contacts.

## Social Media
More than ever before we are all hooked to social media.

## LinkedIn

## Website
I have seen many people (especially students) create a web page to describe themselves in detail and showcase a few projects. I do not consider this to be appropriate nor professional. Projects can easily be shared on GitHub, whereas the extra information about you is not meant to be online. Websites are a convention used in academia or research, where people enumerate their list of papers, collaboraters and share their review activities. For other purposes, LinkedIn is generally sufficient. If you insist on making one make sure it's got a template.

## Blog
Blogs are multi-purpose and used by many - for knowledge sharing, ecommerce, marketing, magazines, etc. It's worth all the extra work if you are a regular and your posts are unique (e.g. travel stories). In all other cases I find it redundant and a waste of domain space. Ask yourself: *What does the blog convey about you?*. Keep your personal life private. On company pages blogs are used for news and recent updates, perhaps even branding.

## GitHub

## Medium
Medium is *the* source of news on technology and engineering, but their catalogue of topics stretches far beyond that and encompasses art, food, culture, humor, sports and music. You can use Medium to keep yourself up to date and build your knowledge. Sharing and subscribing is very simple. and fun.

## Groups
Groups give a sense of belonging. However, most people do not actively contribute nor participate in discussions. Moreover, some just use it to brand themselves. That's plain wrong! Use this opportunity to connect to like-minded members, forge new relationships and grow your network, one step at a time.
