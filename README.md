# How to Build a Strong Online Presence

Whether you are applying for jobs, reaching out for professional advice or toying with a new startup idea your online profile will be instrumental in your success. However, it's not as easy as it might sound. Firstly, time is limited. Secondly, you have only got one chance to impress. Finally, your approach should be focused and appealing for others to take notice and reciprocate the effort.

This post deals with making you put your best foot forward, perfectly suited for job seekers and forming new contacts.

## Social Media
More than ever before we are all hooked to social media. If you do not have a social media strategy yet, make one! Convey a clear, strong and visually enticing message. Simply being active doesn't do it.

## LinkedIn
Ideally, your summary should go back to as far as your education, describe your work experience and skills concisely and comprehensively. There is ample space to share certificates, projects, publications and other feats. Prior work experience during your studies will almost always get you a job. If you are aiming at high profile MNC's such as Google you will have to do well academically unless you can compensate it with project work.

Networking doesn't have to be done in person. Browse through member profiles and connect to those you can relate to on a professional level. Have your CV ready in case you are actively seeking employment.

## Website
I have seen many people (especially students) create a web page to describe themselves in detail and showcase a few projects. I do not consider this to be appropriate nor professional. Projects can easily be shared on GitHub, whereas the extra information about you is not meant to be online. Websites are a convention used in academia or research, where people enumerate their list of papers, collaborators and share their review activities. For other purposes, LinkedIn is generally sufficient. If you insist on making one make sure it's got an aesthetically pleasing template. If you are a business make sure your website is simple and user-friendly.

## Blog
Blogs are multi-purpose and used by many - for knowledge sharing, ecommerce, digital marketing, magazines, etc. It's worth all the extra work if you are a regular and your posts are unique (e.g. travel stories). In all other cases I find it redundant and a waste of domain space. Ask yourself: *What does the blog convey about me?*. Keep your personal life private. On company pages blogs are used for news and recent updates, perhaps even branding.

## GitHub
Everyone should have a GitHub account! Not only can you share your own, but also contribute to others' work. How cool is that? Since active work makes up 80% of your learning (the remaining is pure theory) GitHub perfectly fits into the learning process. If you don't have anything to show learn HTML/CSS and Java, build a couple of websites and share them with the outer world! Open-source contributions will almost immediately get you a job, if not a very good one.

## Medium
Medium is *the* source of news on technology but their catalogue of topics stretches far beyond that and encompasses art, food, culture, humor, sports and music. You can use Medium to keep yourself up to date and build your knowledge. Sharing and subscribing is very simple. and fun.

## Groups
Groups give a sense of belonging. Sadly, most people do not actively contribute nor participate in discussions. Moreover, some just use it to brand themselves. That's plain wrong! Use this opportunity to connect to like-minded members, forge new relationships and grow your network, one step at a time.
